With the rapid development of computer technology and the maturity of 3D technology, the traditional manual modeling method is no longer suitable for building large-scale city models, and oblique photography measurement has become an important means to obtain 3D geospatial information in smart cities. The 3D WebGIS technology can be effectively combined with the oblique photography 3D model, which provides the basic for the construction of large scale city 3D model for the construction of smart city.

As an important carrier of data, the 3D model contains attributes such as building name, year and use, road name, etc., providing the basic data required for urban construction and planning. The 3D Web GIS has good interactivity, which not only manages and analyzes the massive data and presents the real 3D scene model conveniently, but also can be visualized and analyzed through the window, and using the web GIS can combine various charts and 3D models. With the advantages of high restoration, rich texture and fast production of oblique photography model plays an auxiliary planning role for urban neighborhood micro-renewal. Neighborhood micro-renewal is a process of local small-scale and progressive renewal, which needs to realize rapid sharing of planning schemes and fine management of transformation nodes. Therefore, developing WEBGIS 3D platform to assist planning is very necessary at this stage.
